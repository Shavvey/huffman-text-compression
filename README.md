# Huffman Tree Text Compression

## Description

Uses a huffman tree to compress text files, and stores a binary "code" for each
character encountered in the text file inside a min heap binary tree.

## Implementation

The implementation of the huffman tree involve a minheap based on the
relative frequencies of each character encountered in the plaintext file.
